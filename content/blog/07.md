Recently I've dabbled in the world of self-hosting your own email. Initially, I had expected it to be smooth-sailing, since I already host my own website and some other service. However, once I've discovered the world of IP reputation and deliverability issues, it became clear that some effort was needed to host my own email. 

## Initial Plan

Since I already host my website, my thought was that email hosting would be similar. So, my initial plan was that I would host everything and manage everything from receiving to storage to sending. I had just gotten acquainted with how email works and the various protocols that runs it (SMTP, LMTP, IMAP/POP3), and was looking for the best piece of server software to use. Then I [stumbled across this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/tya4ky/comment/i3r910i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). 

It was a list of questions that the user recommended me to ask myself should I plan to host my own mail server.
