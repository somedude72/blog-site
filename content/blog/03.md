More often than not, you might find yourself in situations where your network provider blocks, censors, and monitors their network traffic. For whatever reasons, you may want to not be blocked, or censored, or surveilled while accessing the internet. 

In this article, I'll show you how you can do so by setting up your own obfuscated proxy server on a Raspberry Pi to circumvent this issue. In particular, we'll use the [xray proxy](https://xtls.github.io/en/) protocol and server, which is a nearly undetectable proxy server that uses encryption similar to [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/) to have the proxy traffic blend in with regular web traffic. This means that you can use it even if the network is configured to detect and block proxies. 

You will need the following items to get started:

+ A Raspberry Pi 5
+ A desktop/laptop computer
+ A microSD card (ideally 32GB or more)
+ A private home Wi-Fi

This guide will begin from the very fundamentals of setting up a home server â€” feel free to skip to any sections if you already have your home server set up. However, you should still be somewhat familiar with the Linux command line interface; no god-like Linux skills are necessary, but ideally you know how to edit and run files, install packages, etc. 

## Setup

I'll assume that you've just unboxed your Raspberry Pi. Unless you bought yours from a kit preassembled, it probably does not come with a microSD card, meaning that you will need to buy your own. Any microSD card will do, although if your Raspberry Pi model only has 2GB RAM, I recommend you get a [high endurance](https://www.kingston.com/en/memory-cards/high-endurance-microsd-card) microSD. This is because the 2GB model might use more [swap memory](https://medium.com/@redswitches/a-user-guide-to-swap-memory-548bb93d4ccd), which may cause excessive writes to the card and shorten its lifespan. 

#### Operating System

We need to first install the operating system of the Raspberry Pi. If you already have your preferred choice of operating system installed, feel free to skip to the next portion of the tutorial. 

Otherwise, if you do not have an operating system installed, you can use the official [imager software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to install your choice of operating system. You will need to plug in your microSD card to your local machine first, and then open the imager app. Select your Raspberry Pi version, then the operating system of your choice, and lastly your microSD card. Note that **your microSD card will be wiped and formatted** during the process of installation. 

In terms of the operating system, I went with the Raspberry Pi OS Lite. The Lite version of the operating system removes many unnecessary functionalities, such as a graphical desktop, a browser, and other apps, thus saving valuable space on the microSD card. Because we will be logging into and running the Rasbperry Pi remotely and headless anyway, we won't be needing these.

Click Next > Edit Settings. You can then set your Wi-Fi, login username/password, and other settings to your preference. Then, head over to the "Services" tab and **make sure the "Enable SSH" option is checked**. You can then save the settings and proceed with the installation of the system. After the installation terminates succesfully, you can eject your microSD card and plug it into your Raspberry Pi.

#### SSH

Our main method of accessing our Raspberry Pi will be to log in via [Secure Shell (SSH)](https://www.siteground.com/kb/what-is-ssh/). This allows us to remotely login into the Raspberry Pi from our local machine to send files, commands, et cetera. If you've installed your operating system differently than described above, make sure to verify that you have the OpenSSH server running on your Raspberry Pi. If you do not have the OpenSSH server running, you can find ample tutorials on the internet on how to set up and enable SSH on a Raspberry Pi. 

You will also need an SSH client on your **local machine**. For macOS, the client is built-in and enabled by default. For Windows, you can follow [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/ssh) to enable the OpenSSH client. In addition, you also need to know the local IP address of your Raspberry Pi server. You may need to first connect your Raspberry Pi to Wi-Fi (by plugging it into a keyboard and monitor, for example) using nmcli. 

If you've completed all of the steps above, you can connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH:

```bash
# In this case, admin is the username, and 192.168.0.6 is
# the local IP address of the Raspberry Pi
$ ssh admin@192.168.0.6 
```

## TLS Certificate

Our proxy server requires a TLS encryption tunnel to securely function. In order to establish a TLS tunnel, we need a TLS certificate. If you already have a TLS certificate, feel free to skip this section. Additionally, we will need to **port forward** our Raspberry Pi on ports 80 and 443. If you don't know how to port forward, you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide). 

#### Domain

To get a TLS certificate, we need a domain name (either top-level domains or subdomains work) and a web server. If you do not have a spare domain name to use, you can obtain a free subdomain at [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org). Simply sign up and add a subdomain from the sidebar. Make sure your domain points to your public IP address.

#### Web server

We will also need to install [nginx web server](https://nginx.org/) so that our certificate gets approved correctly. It is recommended to host a website on the server for security purposes, but it is not necessary; rather we just need this website to expose certain directories on our machine to satisfy the TLS certificate verification requirements. 

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nginx
```

Then, open and edit the server configuration file for nginx:

```bash
$ sudoedit /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

You'll need to change the server block to handle requests to our domain to prove to the CA that we actually own our domain. Change the `server_name` below to your domain and `root` directory to somewhere you have write permissions to (you may want to create the root directory first):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen[::]:80 default_server;
    # ...
    root /home/admin/webroot;
    server_name subdomain.domain.com;
}
```

You'll also need to make sure that the nginx user, `www-data` by default, has read and write permissions to the web root. This way the web server can actually read and serve the files in the directories. Keep in mind you may also need to change the permissions of parent directories as well (for example, your home directory if you placed your web root inside it):

```bash
$ sudo chmod a+r /home/admin/webroot
```

Then, restart your nginx server daemon:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ sidp systemctl enable nginx
```

#### Certificate

Now that we have our domain and our web server, we can actually request the certificate. This can also be done for free by using [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Install acme.sh and its aliases:

```bash
$ curl https://get.acme.sh | bash
$ source .bashrc
```

Before actually requesting the certificate, we should first issue a **test certificate**. This way, we can avoid repeatedly requesting certificates because of local configuration errors, resulting in us hitting the rate limit for Let's Encrypt. Then, if everything goes according to plan, we can issue the **actual certificate**. Note that the domain and the path in the commands below are the ones that you entered in the nginx configuration file:

```bash
# Test issuing the certificate. 
$ acme.sh --issue --server letsencrypt_test -d subdomain.domain.com -w /home/admin/webroot
# If everything was successful, issue the actual certificate. Otherwise, try
# browsing through acme.sh's documentation to see if you can fix the issue:
# https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert
$ acme.sh --set-default-ca --server letsencrypt
$ acme.sh --issue -d subdomain.domain.com -w /home/admin/webroot --keylength ec-256 --force
```

Then, **install the certificates** and save the paths for use later. Because the key file isn't readable to other users, and our proxy server runs on the user `nobody` by default (feel free to change it), we will also need to edit its read permissions:

```bash
$ acme.sh --installcert -d subdomain.domain.com --key-file /home/admin/cert.key --fullchain-file /home/admin/fullchain.crt --ecc
$ chmod +r /path/to/cert.key # Add read permissions
```

## Proxy Server

After all of that hassle, we can finally get to setting up the [xray proxy server](https://xtls.github.io/en/). As alluded to earlier, xray works by using encryption similar to TLS to obfuscate the traffic, thereby making it mimic regular web traffic characteristics to any observing middlemen. This is why we first needed an actual TLS certificate issued by a certificate authority, this way the handshake process will look legitimate. To install the xray server:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh | sudo bash
```

#### Server

Now we need to configure the xray server. First, we need to generate a UUID to save for later:

```bash
$ xray uuid
```

Then, open the xray configuration file to edit the behavior of the server:

```bash
$ sudoedit /usr/local/etc/xray/config.json
```

You can check out the [configuration documentation](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/) for xray. However, the documentation, especially the English version, is very poorly written in my opinion. Therefore, I have provided a general template below on what you can customize below. **Make sure to put your UUID in the "inbound > clients" section**:

```json
{
    // The DNS servers that your proxy server will use to query requests
    // from clients. For example, if a client connects to google.com
    // through your proxy, google.com will be resolved using the
    // following DNS servers.
    "dns": {
        "servers": [
            "localhost",
            "1.1.1.1",
            "8.8.8.8"
        ]
    },

    // Categorizing and tagging different types of client connections.
    // For example, the following tags private IP, known advertizers,
    // and torrenting protocol as "block". You can specify how to deal
    // with each of the categories in the outbounds object below. 
    "routing": {
        "domainStrategy": "IPIfNonMatch",
        "rules": [
            {
                "type": "field",
                "ip": ["geoip:private"],
                "outboundTag": "block"
            },
            {
                "type": "field",
                "domain": ["geosite:category-ads-all"],
                "outboundTag": "block"
            },
            {
                "type": "field",
                "protocol": ["bittorrent"],
                "outboundTag": "block"
            }
        ]
    },

    // Handling client connections to the proxy. You should not change
    // the port or the protocol, because they are integral to blending
    // your proxy connections in HTTPS traffic. You can also add settings
    // for multiple clients in the client section below. This will be
    // useful if you want to share your proxy server with others. 
    "inbounds": [
        {
            "port": 443,
            "protocol": "vless",
            "settings": {
                "clients": [
                    {
                        "id": "",           // Put your UUID here! 
                        "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision",
                        "email": "admin",   // The email is mostly for
                        "level": 0          // identification purposes
                    }                       // in the logs. You don't
                ],                          // actually need to put
                                            // a valid email here. 
                "decryption": "none",
              
                // If the inbound traffic is not the vless protocol, we
                // want to fallback to the nginx web server. This can
                // help us disguise our proxy server as an actual website.
                "fallbacks": [{
                    "dest": 80,
                    "xver": 1
                }]
            },

            // These should be pretty self-explanatory TLS encryption
            // settings. Make sure to change the certificate paths. 
            "streamSettings": {
                "network": "tcp",
                "security": "tls",
                "tlsSettings": {
                    "alpn": "http/1.1",
                    "minVersion": "1.2",
                    "maxVersion": "1.3",
                    "certificates": [{
                        "certificateFile": "/home/admin/fullchain.crt",
                        "keyFile": "/home/admin/cert.key"
                    }]
                }
            }
        }
    ],

    // The outbounds section dictates how client traffic is processed
    // based on the tags specified in the inbound section. Any traffic
    // that isn't tagged will be sent to the first outbound. For more
    // information, see the "outbounds" section on the sidebar here:
    // https://xtls.github.io/en/config/outbounds/blackhole.html
    "outbounds": [
        {
            "domainStrategy": "AsIs",
            "tag": "direct",
            "protocol": "freedom"
        },
        {
            "tag": "block",
            "protocol": "blackhole"
        }
    ]
}
```

After you have edited the configuration file to your heart's content, restart the xray server daemon:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart xray
$ sudo systemctl enable xray
```

#### Client

Now the hard part is finally done, we can get to connecting to your new proxy server. The clients that I would suggest you use are:

- [`v2rayN`](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases) (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [`Streisand`](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases) (iOS, macOS)
- [`v2rayNG`](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG/releases) (Android)

Different clients will have different user interfaces, so it is impossible for me to cover how to use each and every client in this blog post. However, I will list out some common settings you may encounter and what those settings will be using our example configuration file:

- Address/SNI: `subdomain.domain.com`
- Flow: `xtls-rprx-vision`
- ALPN: `http/1.1`
- Port: `443`
- Protocol: `vless`
- Network: `TCP`
- Security: `TLS`
- UUID: (your UUID here)

## Conclusion

If you followed through this far, congratulations; no longer will you rely on commercial VPN solutions that barely work to circumvent your state or IT department's content blockers. Therefore, sit back, take a deep breath, relax, knowing that you can finally access discord on your school's Wi-Fi.
