In this article, I'll show you how you can set up your own simple and undetectable VPN server using a Raspberry Pi 5. This tutorial is for people who are somewhat familiar with the linux command line interface. You should ideally know how to edit and run files, install packages, etc. No god-like linux skills are necessary. 

You will need the following items to get started:

+ A Raspberry Pi 5
+ A desktop/laptop computer
+ A microSD card (32GB or more)
+ A private home Wi-Fi

This guide will begin from the very fundamentals. Feel free to skip to any sections if you already have your Raspberry Pi set up. 

## Setup

I'll assume that you've just unboxed your Raspberry Pi. Unless you bought yours from a [kit](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-5) preassembled, it probably does not come with a microSD card, meaning that you will need to buy your own. Any microSD card will do, although if your Raspberry Pi model only has 2GB RAM, I recommend you get a [high endurance](https://www.kingston.com/en/memory-cards/high-endurance-microsd-card) microSD. This is because the 2GB model might use more [swap memory](https://medium.com/@redswitches/a-user-guide-to-swap-memory-548bb93d4ccd), which may cause excessive writes to the card and shorten its lifespan. 

#### Operating System

We need to first install the operating system of the Raspberry Pi. If you already have your preferred choice of operating system installed, feel free to skip this portion of the tutorial. 

If you do not have an operating system installed, you can use the official [imager software](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to install your choice of operating system. You will need to plug in your microSD card to your local machine first, and then open the imager app. Select your Raspberry Pi version, then the operating system of your choice, and lastly your microSD card. Note that **your microSD card will be wiped and formatted** during the process of installation. 

In terms of the operating system, I recommend going with the Raspberry Pi OS Lite. The Lite version of the operating system removes many unnecessary functionalities such as a graphical desktop, a browser, and other apps, thus saving valuable space on the microSD card. Because we will be logging into and running the Rasbperry Pi remotely and headless anyways, we won't be needing these.

Click Next > Edit Settings. You can then set your Wi-Fi, login username/password, and other settings to your preference. Then, head over to the "Services" tab and **make sure the "Enable SSH" option is checked**. You can then save the settings and proceed with the installation of the system. After the installation terminates succesfully, you can eject your microSD card and plug it into your Raspberry Pi.

#### SSH

Our main method of accessing our Raspberry Pi will be to [SSH](https://www.siteground.com/kb/what-is-ssh/) into it. This allows us to remotely login into the Raspberry Pi from our local machine to send files, commands, etcetera. If you've installed your operating system in a different way than described above, make sure to verify that you have the OpenSSH server running on your Raspberry Pi. If you do not have the OpenSSH server running, you can find ample tutorials on the internet on how to set up and enable SSH on a Raspberry Pi. 

You will also need an SSH client on your **local machine**. For macOS, the client is built-in and enabled by default. For Windows, you can follow [this tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/tutorials/ssh) to enable the OpenSSH client. In addition, you also need to know the local IP address of your Raspberry Pi server. Note that you may need to first connect your Raspberry Pi to wifi (ex. by plugging it into a keyboard and monitor) using nmcli. 

If you've complete all of the steps above, you can connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH:

```bash
# In this case, admin is the username, and 192.168.0.6 is
# the local IP address of the Raspberry Pi
$ ssh admin@192.168.0.6 
```

## TLS Certificate

Our VPN requires a [TLS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/) encryption tunnel to securely function. In order to establish a TLS tunnel, we need a TLS certificate. If you already have a TLS certificate, feel free to skip this section. Additionally, we will need to **port forward** our Raspberry Pi on ports 80 and 443. If you don't know how to port forward, you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide). 

#### Domain

To get a TLS certificate, we need a domain name (either top-level domains or subdomains work) and a web server. If you do not have a spare domain name to use, you can obtain a free subdomain at [FreeDNS](https://freedns.afraid.org). Simply sign up and add a subdomain from the sidebar. Make sure your domain points to your public IP address.

#### Web server

We will also need to install  [nginx](https://nginx.org/) as our web server so that our certificate gets approved correctly. We do not have to host a website on the server; rather we just need this website to expose certain directories on our machine to satisfy the TLS certificate verification requirements. 

```bash
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nginx
```

Then, open and edit the server configuration file for nginx:
```bash
$ sudoedit /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

We need to change the server block to handle requests to our domain to prove to the CA that we actually own our domain. Change the `server_name` below to your domain and `root` directory to somewhere you have write permissions to (you may want to create the root directory first):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen[::]:80 default_server;
    # ...
    root /home/admin/webroot;
    server_name subdomain.domain.com;
}
```

We will also need to make sure that the nginx user, `www-data` by default, has read and write permissions to the web root. This way the web server can actually read and serve the files in the directories. Keep in mind you may also need to change the permissions of parent directories as well (for example, your home directory if you placed your web root inside of it):

```bash
$ sudo chmod a+r /home/admin/webroot
```

Then, restart your nginx server daemon:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ sidp systemctl enable nginx
```

#### Certificate

Now that we have our domain and our web server, we can actually request the certificate. This can also be done for free by using [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) and [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Install acme.sh and its aliases:

```bash
$ curl https://get.acme.sh | bash
$ source .bashrc
```

Before actually requesting the certificate, we should first issue a **test cerficiate**. This way, we can avoid repeatedly requesting certificates because of local configuration errors, resulting in us hitting the rate limit for Let's Encrypt. Then, if everything goes according to plan, we can issue the **actual certificate**. Note that the domain and the path in the commands below are the ones that you entered in the nginx configuration file:

```bash
# Test issuing the certificate. 
$ acme.sh --issue --server letsencrypt_test -d subdomain.domain.com -w /home/admin/webroot
# If everything was successful, issue the actual certificate. Otherwise, try
# browsing through acme.sh's documentation to see if you can fix the issue:
# https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/How-to-issue-a-cert
$ acme.sh --set-default-ca --server letsencrypt
$ acme.sh --issue -d subdomain.domain.com -w /home/admin/webroot --keylength ec-256 --force
```

Then, **install the certificates** and save the paths for use later. Because the key file isn't readable to other users, and our VPN server runs on the user `nobody`, we will also need to edit its read permissions:

```bash
$ acme.sh --installcert -d subdomain.domain.com --key-file /home/admin/cert.key --fullchain-file /home/admin/fullchain.crt --ecc
$ chmod +r /path/to/cert.key # Add read permissions
```

## VPN (Xray)

After all of that hassle, we can finally get to setting up the VPN server. We will be using [xray](https://xtls.github.io/en/), a virtually undetectable VPN protocol and server developed to circumvent the [internet firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) of China. It works by using TLS-like encryption to obfuscate the traffic, thereby making it **mimic regular HTTPS traffic characteristics** to any observing middlemen. This is why we first needed an actual TLS certificate issued by a certificate authority, this way the handshake process will look legitimate. To install the xray server:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh | sudo bash
```

#### Server

Now we need to configure the xray server. First, we need to generate a UUID to save for later:

```bash
$ xray uuid
```

Then, open the xray configuration file to edit the behavior of the server:
```bash
$ sudoedit /usr/local/etc/xray/config.json
```

You can check out the [configuration documentation](https://xtls.github.io/en/config/) for xray. However, the documentation, especially the English version, is very poorly written in my opinion. Therefore, I have provided a general template below on what you can customize below. **Make sure to put your UUID in the "inbound > clients" section**:

```json
{
    // The DNS servers that your VPN server will use to query requests
    // from clients. For example, if a client connects to google.com
    // through your VPN, google.com will be resolved using the following
    // DNS servers.
    "dns": {
        "servers": [
            "localhost",
            "1.1.1.1",
            "8.8.8.8"
        ]
    },

    // Categorizing and tagging different types of client connections.
    // For example, the following tags private IP, known advertizers,
    // and torrenting protocol as "block". You can specify how to deal
    // with each of the categories in the outbounds object below. 
    "routing": {
        "domainStrategy": "IPIfNonMatch",
        "rules": [
            {
                "type": "field",
                "ip": ["geoip:private"],
                "outboundTag": "block"
            },
            {
                "type": "field",
                "domain": ["geosite:category-ads-all"],
                "outboundTag": "block"
            },
            {
                "type": "field",
                "protocol": ["bittorrent"],
                "outboundTag": "block"
            }
        ]
    },

    // Handling client connections to the VPN. You should not change the
    // port or the protocol, because they are integral to blending your
    // VPN connections in HTTPS traffic. You can also add settings for
    // multiple clients in the client section below. This will be useful
    // if you want to share your VPN server with others. 
    "inbounds": [
        {
            "port": 443,
            "protocol": "vless",
            "settings": {
                "clients": [
                    {
                        "id": "",           // Put your UUID here! 
                        "flow": "xtls-rprx-vision",
                        "email": "admin",   // The email is mostly for
                        "level": 0          // identification purposes
                    }                       // in the logs. You don't
                ],                          // actually need to put
                                            // a valid email here. 
                "decryption": "none",
              
                // If the inbound traffic is not the vless protocol, we
                // want to fallback to the nginx web server. This can
                // help us disguise our VPN server as an actual website.
                "fallbacks": [{
                    "dest": 80,
                    "xver": 1
                }]
            },

            // These should be pretty self-explanatory TLS encryption
            // settings. Make sure to change the certificate paths. 
            "streamSettings": {
                "network": "tcp",
                "security": "tls",
                "tlsSettings": {
                    "alpn": "http/1.1",
                    "minVersion": "1.2",
                    "maxVersion": "1.3",
                    "certificates": [{
                        "certificateFile": "/home/admin/fullchain.crt",
                        "keyFile": "/home/admin/cert.key"
                    }]
                }
            }
        }
    ],

    // The outbounds section dictates how client traffic is processed
    // based on the tags specified in the inbound section. Any traffic
    // that isn't tagged will be sent to the first outbound. For more
    // information, see the "outbounds" section on the sidebar here:
    // https://xtls.github.io/en/config/outbounds/blackhole.html
    "outbounds": [
        {
            "domainStrategy": "AsIs",
            "tag": "direct",
            "protocol": "freedom"
        },
        {
            "tag": "block",
            "protocol": "blackhole"
        }
    ]
}
```

After you have edited the configuration file to your heart's content, restart the xray server daemon:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl restart xray
$ sudo systemctl enable xray
```

#### Client

Now the hard part is finally done, we can get to connecting to your new VPN server. The clients that I would suggest you use are:

- [`v2rayN`](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases) (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [`Streisand`](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayN/releases) (iOS, macOS)
- [`v2rayNG`](https://github.com/2dust/v2rayNG/releases) (Android)

Different clients will have different user interfaces, so it is impossible for me to cover how to use each and every client in this blog post. However, I will list out some common settings you may encounter and what those settings will be using our example configuration file:

- Address/SNI: `subdomain.domain.com`
- Flow: `xtls-rprx-vision`
- ALPN: `http/1.1`
- Port: `443`
- Protocol: `vless`
- Network: `TCP`
- Security: `TLS`
- UUID: (your UUID here)

## Conclusion

If you followed through this far, congrats! No longer will you rely on commercial VPN solutions that barely work to circumvent your IT department's content blockers. So sit back, relax, knowing that you can finally access discord on your school's Wi-Fi.

(TLDR: I hope this article has been helpful for you to set up your own VPN server)
