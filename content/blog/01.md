Hello there! I finally got my website set up and running. The website itself is built by the static website generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This allows me to write all of my pages and blog posts as markdown files without worrying about website building. 

I could've also used website creators such as [Wix](https://www.wix.com/) or [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/) to create and host my blog. These services would treat me well if I wished to get a website up fast. However, using hosting services means that I retain less control over my website and my data, which is not ideal. In addition, tinkering with software to get a website up and running is really satisfying. This is why I opted to go the self-hosted route. 

In these blogs, I plan on writing about any of the following topics:
 - Software and programming
 - System admin
 - Machine learning
 - Random thoughts
