Hi there! My name is Zichen, and congratulations on stumbling into my blog website! I am a high school student in Silicon Valley. I enjoy programming, skiing, and cooking (although I'm not very good at it). I speak English, Mandarin, [Sichuanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuanese_dialects) with varying levels of proficiency. Here, you will find [blog posts](https://blog.withzichen.com/blog/) that I write when I experience extreme boredom or when I go through any noteworthy experiences. The blog posts probably won't be super good though.

I've a friend who always jokes that I DDOS'd him whenever something broke in his computer or the web service he's trying to access. However, while me DDOS'ing my friend is a joke, [cybersecurity is most definitely not](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q4/). So, I kindly ask here that you — ahem — please refrain from sending extraneous packets to intentionally overwhelm my network infrastructure. No but seriously, don't DDOS me. 

#### Website

This website is created using the [hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) with a minimally customized [hugo blog awesome theme](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome). It is hosted on my Raspberry Pi sitting behind the [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) infrastructure. The source code for the site is located [on GitHub](https://github.com/somedude72/blog-site). Thanks to the creators of all of these tools as well as numerous YouTube tutorials for making it possible and easy for me to create this website.

This website solely reflects my opinion, which may or may not me factual or correct. Please be sure to do your research before believing in what I say! 

#### Contact

You can reach out and contact me by email at my public email [connect@withzichen.com](mailto:connect@withzichen.com). You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/somedude72), where I publish the computery things that I've been working on (most of which are just results of me getting lost in some random rabbit hole), and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/somedude_72), where I sometimes post stuff. 

And lastly I hope whoever is reading this have a wonderful rest of your day :)
