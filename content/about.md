Hi there! My name is Zichen (if you haven't noticed), and congratulations on stumbling into my personal website! I am a high school student located in Silicon Valley. I enjoy programming, skiing, and cooking (although I'm not very good at it). I speak English, Mandarin, [Sichuanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuanese_dialects) with varying levels of proficiency. Here, you will find [blog posts](https://blog.withzichen.com/blog/) that I write when I experience extreme boredom or when I go through any noteworthy experiences. The blog posts probably won't be very frequently updated though.

#### Website

This website is created using the [hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) with a minimally customized [hugo blog awesome theme](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome). It is hosted on my Raspberry Pi sitting behind the [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) infrastructure. The source code for the site is located [on GitHub](https://github.com/somedude72/blog-site). Thanks to the creators of all of these tools as well as numerous YouTube tutorials for making it possible and easy for me to create this website.

This website solely reflects my opinion, which may or may not me factual or correct. Please be sure to do your research before believing in what I say.
