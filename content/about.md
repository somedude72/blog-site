Hi there, my name is Zichen. 

Sometimes I'll write about a noteworthy story here, but most of the time the blog posts will be aboue exploring rabbit holes on niche computer topics. See [the start of my blog](/blog/01) for more info, or check out [some fun projects](/projects).

I enjoy cooking, skiing, and music. I used to be pretty good on the piano, but I've fallen out of love with it at some point. I still love music though, maybe I'll pick up piano or some other instrument at some point.
