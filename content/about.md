Hi there! My name is Zichen, and welcome to my website! Most of the time I'll write a new blog post here when I go down a deep rabbit hole on some niche computer topic that I'm currently screwing around on. Sometimes you might also catch me writing about a noteworthy story. 

I also enjoy cooking, skiing, and music. I used to be pretty good on the piano, but I've fallen out of love with it at some point. I still love music though, maybe I'll pick up piano or some other instrument at some point.

#### Website

This website is created using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/) with a minimally customized [Hugo Blog Awesome theme](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome). It is hosted on my Raspberry Pi sitting behind the [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) infrastructure. The source code for the site is located [on GitHub](https://github.com/somedude72/blog-site). Thanks to the creators of all of these tools as well as numerous YouTube tutorials for making it possible and easy for me to create this website.

I've a friend who always jokes that I DDOS'd him whenever something broke in his computer or the web service he's trying to access. However, while me DDOS'ing my friend is a joke, [cybersecurity is most definitely not](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q4/). So, I kindly ask here that you here to please refrain from sending extraneous packets to intentionally overwhelm my network infrastructure. No but seriously, don't DDOS me.
