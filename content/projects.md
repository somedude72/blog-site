Below is an aggregate of most of the projects I've worked on in my spare time. Most of these projects are completely just me screwing around for fun. These projects are also open source and present on Github if there are any source code. They are roughly ordered from oldest to newest (newest on top):

 - [Vint](https://github.com/SomedudeX/vint): a c++ library that provides [arbitrary precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) operations. 
 - [Mpeg-convert](https://github.com/SomedudeX/mpeg-convert): a wrapper for [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) that adds presets and progress bars to ffmpeg.
 - A [machine learning model](https://github.com/SomedudeX/posture-detection) for detecting good and bad posture from webcam input
 - A basic [command-line calculator](https://github.com/SomedudeX/py-calculator) written in Python. My first ever programming project.
