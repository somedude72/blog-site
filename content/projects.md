Here are some of the projects I've worked on in my spare time. Most of these projects are completely just me screwing around for fun. These projects are also present on [my Github](https://github.com/somedude72) if you feel inclined to check them out. They are roughly ordered from oldest to newest (newest on top):

 - [Minesweeper](https://github.com/somedude72/minesweeper): a clone of the original minesweeper program found on Windows 95. 
 - [Vint](https://github.com/somedude72/vint): a c++ library that provides [arbitrary precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) operations. This is currently unfinished, and development is really slow because implementing such a library is really technical (especially because of performance/algorithm issues). Obviously, there are already tons of libraries that does this function out in the wild, but I thought that making my own would be fun and a good educational journey for me. 
 - [Vidsrc-search](https://github.com/somedude72/vidsrc-search): a now-defunct searcher for a movie piracy website. I think the owners of the site got so many DCMA takedowns that they had to constantly change their domains and APIs; that made this project really difficult to maintain, so I decided to shut it down not long afterwards. 
 - [Mpeg-convert](https://github.com/somedude72/mpeg-convert): a wrapper for [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) that adds presets and progress bars to FFmpeg.
 - A [machine learning model](https://github.com/somedude72/posture-detection) for detecting good and bad posture from webcam input
 - A basic [command-line calculator](https://github.com/somedude72/py-calculator) written in Python. My first ever programming project.
