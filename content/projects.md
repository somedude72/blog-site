Here are some cool projects I made in my spare time. Most of these projects are completely just me screwing around for fun. These projects are also present on [my Github](https://github.com/somedude72) if you feel inclined to check them out. They are roughly ordered from oldest to newest (newest on top):

 - [Vint](https://github.com/somedude72/vint): A C++ library that provides [arbitrary precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) operations. See [blog](/blog/04/).
 - [Minesweeper](https://github.com/somedude72/minesweeper): A clone of the original minesweeper program found on Windows 95. 
 - [Mpeg-convert](https://github.com/somedude72/mpeg-convert): A wrapper for [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) that adds presets and progress bars.
 - A [machine learning model](https://github.com/somedude72/posture-detection) for detecting good and bad posture from webcam input
 - A [command-line calculator](https://github.com/somedude72/py-calculator) written in Python. My first ever programming project.
