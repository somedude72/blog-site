## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal blog site.
 + The blog site itself can be found [here](https://codewithzichen.bine.me/)
 + The website uses static website generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
 + The website uses a modified version of the [hugo blog awesome](https://github.com/hugo-sid/hugo-blog-awesome) theme
 + The website uses [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) as a commenting system

All blogs are stored in `content/blogs` as markdown files. If you would like to reach out or have any questions, please open an issue. Thanks!
